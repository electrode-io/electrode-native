> Electrode Native is a mobile platform that streamlines the integration of React Native components into existing mobile applications. With minimal changes required to the application code base and infrastructure, Electrode Native makes it simpler to leverage React Native potential in any mobile application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 8
- NPM >= 3.0
- Android Studio (for Android apps)
- Xcode >= 10 (for iOS apps)

### Install

```console
$ npm install -g electrode-native && ern
```

### Trying it

We have created a [step by step guide], for iOS and Android, to present some of the concepts and features of Electrode Native, through the development of a simple mobile application listing some movies.

## Documentation

The [documentation of Electrode Native] is maintained as [GitBook] pages in the [docs](/docs) directory.  
It is divided into multiple sections :

- An [Overview] of Electrode Native  
This should be read first, as an introduction to learn about [what is Electrode Native] or [what is a MiniApp]. This section also contains some documentation regarding the [Electrode Native workflow], native dependencies management or JS/Native communication.

- A Platform Reference section  
This section covers each Electrode Native module in depth, such as [Container], [Cauldron], [Manifest], [Apis] ...

- A CLI command reference section  
In this section you will find a documentation page for each of the CLI commands available in Electrode Native, for example [create-miniapp], 
[run-android], [platform use] ...

## Contributing

We embrace contributions, be it documentation, issue reporting, or contributing code.
