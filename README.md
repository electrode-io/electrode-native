## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 4.5
- NPM >= 3.0
- Android Studio (for Android apps)
- Xcode >=8.3.2 (for iOS apps)

### Install

```console
$ npm install -g electrode-native && ern
```

### Trying it

We have created a [step by step guide], for iOS and Android, to present some of the concepts and features of Electrode Native, through the development of a simple mobile application listing some movies.

## Documentation

The [documentation of Electrode Native] is maintained as [GitBook] pages in the [docs](/docs) directory.  
It is divided into multiple sections :

- An [Overview] of Electrode Native  
This should be read first, as an introduction to learn about [what is Electrode Native] or [what is a MiniApp]. This section also contains some documentation regarding the [Electrode Native workflow], native dependencies management or JS/Native communication.

- A Platform Reference section  
This section covers each Electrode Native module in depth, such as [Container], [Cauldron], [Manifest], [Apis] ...

- A CLI command reference section  
In this section you will find a documentation page for each of the CLI commands available in Electrode Native, for example [create-miniapp], 
[run-android], [platform use] ...

## Contributing

We embrace contributions, be it documentation, issue reporting, or contributing code.

Please read our [CONTRIBUTING guide](docs/overview/contributing.md) for more details on how to contribute.
