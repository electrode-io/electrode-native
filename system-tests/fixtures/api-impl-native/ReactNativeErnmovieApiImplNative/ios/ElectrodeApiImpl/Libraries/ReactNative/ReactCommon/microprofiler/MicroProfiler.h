/**
 * MicroProfiler is a performance profiler for measuring the cumulative impact of
 * a large number of small-ish calls. This is normally a problem for standard profilers
 * like Systrace because the overhead of the profiler itself skews the timings you
 * are able to collect. This is especially a problem when doing nested calls to
 * profiled functions, as the parent calls will contain the overhead of their profiling
 * plus the overhead of all their childrens' profiling.
 *
 * MicroProfiler attempts to be low overhead by 1) aggregating timings in memory and
 * 2) trying to remove estimated profiling overhead from the returned timings.
 *
 * To remove estimated overhead, at the beginning of each trace we calculate the
 * average cost of profiling a no-op code section, as well as invoking the average
 * cost of invoking the system clock. The former is subtracted out for each child
 * profiler section that is invoked within a parent profiler section. The latter is
 * subtracted from each section, child or not.
 *
 * After MicroProfiler::stopProfiling() is called, a table of tracing data is emitted
 * to glog (which shows up in logcat on Android).
