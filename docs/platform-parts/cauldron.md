## Electrode React Native Cauldron

A Cauldron is a centralized database or configuration file that is used to store information about mobile application versions, native dependencies, and information about MiniApps. One cauldron file exists for each mobile application. With appropriate permissions, you can use the ERN CLI commands to access and modify the configuration settings in the cauldron file.

The cauldron file also contains:
* One record for each mobile application version, for example: walmart ios 17.15 and walmart android 17.10.0.
* Data pertaining to a specific mobile application version including all MiniApps (and their versions) that are currently part of the version
* A list of all native dependencies and their versions--that are used by the MiniApps
* A list of native dependencies that are not dependent upon by any MiniApp such as native API implementations
* A running list of all MiniApp versions that have been pushed as Over-the-Air (OTA) updates for a given mobile application version

The cauldron file is a single JSON document: `cauldron.json`

In order to use a MiniApp in any mobile application, first you need to add the MiniApp to the cauldron for that mobile application version. The cauldron then performs compatibility checks to confirm that the MiniApp version (to be added to the target mobile application version) contains only native dependencies that are supported and that the versions are properly aligned with the mobile application version.

If compatibility checks pass, a new container version is generated and published. The new container file is updated with the changes and the mobile application version data in the Cauldron is updated accordingly to reflect the current new state of the container. The occurs when the mobile application version is not released yet. If the version are not compatible, a container can not be created or updated. In this case, additional compatibility checks are performed and the MiniApp can be CodePushed instead.

The cauldron can store `yarn.lock` files that are used internally to guarantee consistency of non-updated MiniApp versions.

Using the ERN CLI, you can access multiple cauldron files. There can however be only one cauldron file activated at a time.


### The cauldron configuration file

The following is an example of a `cauldron.json` file.
```json

              "yarnlock": "3ed0a5981a22d89d3b30d6e2011b5b581581771c",
              "nativeDeps": [

                "react-native-vector-icons@4.0.0",
                "react-native-code-push@1.17.1-beta"
              ],
              "miniApps": {
                "container": [
                  "react-native-weather-overview@1.0.0",
                  "react-native-weather-details@2.1.3",
                ],
                "codePush": [
                 [
                   "react-native-weather-overview@1.0.0",
                   "react-native-weather-details@2.0.0",
                 ]
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

This example `cauldron.json` file shows the following:  
* This cauldron contains global configurations as well as a single Android mobile application: (MyWeatherApp)version (1.0.0).  
* This mobile application version contains two MiniApps (these might be two screens of the application).  
* This mobile application version has been released and one CodePush update has been performed to update the version of one of the two MiniApps.  

The configuration also shows the different objects stored in the cauldron--level by level.

* A config object (optional) and a nativeApps array  
* Currently the cauldron contains only a manifest configuration. For details about the manifest and its configuration, see the information about the  [ERN Manifest](url).  

* The `nativeapps` array contains the data of all mobile applications that are part of the cauldron. A cauldron file can store multiple mobile applications, however it is not recommended that a cauldron file contains data for multiple mobile applications--instead, we recommend that you use one cauldron per mobile application.  

* For each mobile application, the second level is the platforms array. ERN supports two platforms: Android and iOS. For each platform, there can be multiple versions of a mobile application. At this level (mobile application + platform + version), most of the Cauldron data resides.  

* At the Android platform level of the `MyWeatherApp` application, a configuration object contains data that applies to every version of the `MyWeatherApp` for the Android platform. It also contains CodePush configurations. For information about CodePush, see the [CodePush documentation](url) for more details. For information about the containuer generator configuration, see the [Container documentation](url).

For each unique version of a mobile application, the cauldron stores the following:

- `ernPlatformVersion` : The version of Electrode React Native used.
- `isReleased` : `true` if this version is released to users and `false` if not (the release is in development)
- `yarnlock` : The SHA of the `yarn.lock` file stored in the cauldron filestore - this should be used for generating the composite JavaSript bundle.
- `nativeDeps` : An array of native dependencies descriptors, corresponding to the native dependencies stored in the current container of this version
- `miniApps` : MiniApps package descriptors  corresponding to the MiniApps currently part of the container of this version or released through CodePush updates

### Setting up a cauldron


Setting up a cauldron is basically the same process as creating a Git repository and storing the data in the repository. To host your cauldron, you can use any provider offering Git repository storage. GitHub and BitBucket are probably two of the most popular providers. Within our documentation, we mention GitHub but you can use your own provider.

To create your own mobile application cauldron:

1) Create a new GitHub repository to host your cauldron.  
While there are no repository naming conventions, we recommend that you name it: `[mobile_app_name]-cauldron`

Note: A cauldron is bound to one mobile application--even though it can hold multiple mobile applications. We do not recommend holding multiple mobile applications within a cauldron.

2) Add the cauldron to the repository using the ERN CLI.  
`ern cauldron repo add`

3) Add your first mobile application version in the cauldron.  
`ern cauldron add nativeapp`

### Cauldron compatibility checks

Any MiniApp or native dependency that needs to be added to a mobile application version stored in the cauldron will go through a series of version compatibility checks. If any of these checks fails, the MiniApp or dependency won't be added to the cauldron. This is one reason not to modify the cauldron repository manually as it results in bypassing compatibility checks.

The Cauldron performs the compatibility checks to make sure that any MiniApp or native dependency version added to a mobile application version, will not lead to runtime issues  with other MiniApps and dependencies already part of the container of the mobile application.

The compatibility checks are primarily checking the native dependency versions proper alignment--React Native and any native module or API or API implementation that the MiniApp uses.

Listed below are some of the compatibility checks and logic that is performed by Electrode React Native, when running an operation changing the state of a container--what it will contain will change, following the operation, or the state of the composite JavaScript bundle--in the case of an OTA update using CodePush.

- Adding a new MiniApp
    - To a in-development mobile application version  
For each of the native dependencies included in the MiniApp:
        - Nothing to do if the native dependency is already in the Container, using the same version.
        - If the native dependency is not already in the Container, add it.
        - If the native dependency is already in the Container but with a different version, ensure that the versions are backward compatible (for third-party native modules we don't consider backward compatibility--the platform requires an exact version match, however APIs follow more flexible rules). If that is the case and the version of the dependency used by the MiniApp is greater than the one in the Container, bump the version of the dependency in the container to the one used by the MiniApp. If that is not the case, the process fails.

    - To a released mobile application version
For each of the native dependencies included in the MiniApp:
       - Nothing to do if the native dependency is already in the Container, using the same version.
       - If the native dependency is not already in the Container, fail. It is not possible to add a native dependency using OTA updates (for third-party native modules we don't consider backward compatibility, the platform requires an exact version match, whereas APIs follow more flexible rules). If that is the case and the version of the dependency used by the MiniApp is lower than the one in the Container, proceed. Otherwise, fail.

- Removing a MiniApp  
Compatibility checks are not performed and ERN does not try to remove any of the native dependencies used by the MiniApp.

- Updating a MiniApp version  
Compatibility checks are the same as the checks performed when adding a new MiniApp. See information in the Adding a new MiniApp bullet item above.

When directly adding, updating, or removing native dependencies in a mobile application version, the following applies only for in-development mobile application versions. It is not possible to add, remove, or update a native dependency version using an OTA update.

- Adding a new native dependency
Compatibility checks are not performed. If this is a new native dependency, add it as it won't conflict with existin versions.

- Updating a native dependency version  
Ensure of backward compatibility--only forward version updates are allowed.

- Removing a native dependency  
Verify that there are no MiniApps in the the Container using the native dependency that you want to remove.

### Granting access to the cauldron

Depending on the size of your organization and team, and your intended ERN workflow, it's possible that only one person should be granted Write access to the Cauldron. This person is usually a Release Manager or Mobile App Lead. In this scenario, MiniApp developers are granted Read access--because ERN needs some data from the cauldron. If there are dedicated MiniApps developers for the mobile application, they will need to publish new versions of their MiniApps to npm, and the Release Manager manages the Cauldron.

Alternatively, you can give Write access to the cauldron--to MiniApp developers as well. In this scenario, as soon as the MiniApp developers publish new versions of their MiniApps, they can add them directly to the Cauldron.

### Guidelines and limitations

* While Git offers many benefits compared to a large database system, developers who are familiar with Git repositories are also familiar with the Git repository workflow--which doesn't match the workflow when working with a cauldron repository. For example, developers working in a Git repository might be tempted to fork, branch, and issue pull requests for a cauldron. Doing so will result in compatibility check failures.

* A Cauldron can only be updated using the ERN CLI commands. You should not update the Cauldron 'manually'. If you update a cauldron manually, you bypass all compatibility checks performed by Electrode React Native and you risk desynchronizing the container version and the yarn locks.

Note: Open a support ticket if you aren't able to update information in the cauldron using the ERN CLI commands. It's possible that an existing command can be updated or a new command may be issued.

### Related commands

- `ern cauldron *`  
All sub-commands inside the `ern cauldron` command are used to access or update the state of the cauldron.
