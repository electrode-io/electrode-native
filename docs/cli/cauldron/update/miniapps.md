## `ern cauldron update miniapps`

#### Description

* Update one or more MiniApps versions in a non-released native application version in a Cauldron  
* Perform multiple checks, including MiniApp dependencies analysis, to ensure compatibility with the target native application container  
* Generate and publish a new Container version  

#### Syntax

`ern cauldron update miniapps <miniapps..>`  

**Arguments**

`<miniapps..>`

* One or more MiniApp(s) (delimited by spaces) to update in a target native application version in the Cauldron.
* You can only update with MiniApp(s) version(s) that have been published to NPM. 
* You cannot use the `file` or `git` schemes for the MiniApp(s).
* The version of each MiniApp is corresponding to the version to update to. 

**Options**  

`--containerVersion/-v <version>`

* Specify a version for the new container  
* **Default**  Incremental patch number of the current container version  
Example: If the current container version is 1.2.3 and a version is not included in the command, the new container version will be 1.2.4.  

`--descriptor/-d <descriptor>`

* Update the MiniApps to a given target non-released native application version in the Cauldron matching the provided native application descriptor.  
* You can only pass a complete native application descriptor as the MiniApps updated using this command targets only a specific single native application version.  
**Default**  Lists all non-released native application versions from the Cauldron and prompts you to choose a descriptor.   

`--force/-f`

* Bypass compatibility checks and force-update the MiniApp in the Cauldron.  
**Caution**  Before using the `--force/-f` option, be sure that you can bypass compatibility checks.

#### Remarks

* If one MiniApp does not pass compatibility checks, the command will fail (unless `force` flag is used)
