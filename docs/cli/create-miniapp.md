## `ern create-miniapp`

#### Description

* Create a new MiniApp in a new directory named after the MiniApp.  

The generated MiniApp is a starter `HelloWorld MiniApp` that you can use to launch a standalone MiniApp on the iOS or Android platforms in our Runnerâ€”using the `ern run-ios` and `ern run-android` commands.  

If you used react-native previously, you'll notice that the generated JavaScript react-native MiniApp is exactly the same react-native starter app as the one provided by react-native. A MiniApp is simply a react-native application. One of the differences with react-native is that we generate our own native projects which use a locally-generated `ern` container.

iOS and Android directories are not generated by this command. To generate those directories, run the `ern run-ios` or `ern run-android` commands.

#### Syntax

`ern create-miniapp <appName>`

**Arguments**

`<appName>`
