## `ern create-miniapp`

#### Description

* Create a new MiniApp in a new directory named after the MiniApp.  

The generated MiniApp is a starter `hello world MiniApp` that you can use to launch a standalone MiniApp on the iOS or Android platforms in our Runnerâ€”using the `ern run-ios` and `ern run-android` commands.  

If you used react-native previously, you'll notice that the generated JavaScript react-native MiniApp is exactly the same react-native starter app as the one provided by react-native. A MiniApp is simply a react-native application. One of the differences with react-native is that we generate our own native projects which use a locally-generated `ern` container.

iOS and Android directories are not generated by this command. To generate those directories, run the `ern run-ios` or `ern run-android` commands.

#### Syntax

`ern create-miniapp <name>`  

**Arguments**

`<name>`

* The name to use for the MiniApp.

**Options**  

`--scope <scope>`

* Specify the npm scope for the MiniApp package   
* Add the scope automatically in the `package.json` file of the generated MiniApp  

`--platformVersion/-v <version>`

* Specify a platform version if different from the currently activated version  
* This option is rarely used.  
* This option uses the templates and dependency versions bound to a given `ern` platform version to create the MiniApp.

`--skipNpmCheck/-s`
* Skips npm check to see if the package already exists
* **Default** The value defaults to false. 

#### Examples

`ern create-miniapp MyAwesomeApp`  
This example shows how to create a directory `MyAwesomeApp` containing the generated MiniApp.  

`ern create-miniapp MyAwesomeApp --scope MyCompany`  
This example shows how to set the `name` field in the `package.json` file with `@MyCompany/MyAwesomeApp`.

#### Remarks

* You cannot use any special characters for your MiniApp name, including dashes (-).  
* This command is the `ern` equivalent of the `react-native init` command.
